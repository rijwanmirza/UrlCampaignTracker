/**
 * This script fixes the issue with URLs that have click limit set to 0 (unlimited)
 * Implementation note: The code has been manually fixed directly in storage.ts
 * 
 * Three key fixes were implemented:
 * 
 * 1. In getUrls method, updated the code that determines if a URL has reached its click limit:
 *    Original:
 *    ```
 *    let limitReached = false;
 *    if (isActive && url.clickLimit !== null && url.clickLimit > 0) {
 *      limitReached = url.clicks >= url.clickLimit;
 *    }
 *    ```
 *    
 *    Fixed:
 *    ```
 *    let limitReached = false;
 *    if (isActive && url.clickLimit !== null && url.clickLimit > 0 && url.clicks >= url.clickLimit) {
 *      limitReached = true;
 *    }
 *    ```
 * 
 * 2. In getWeightedUrlDistribution method, updated the filter for active URLs:
 *    Original:
 *    ```
 *    const activeUrls = allUrls.filter(url => url.status === "active" && url.weight > 0);
 *    ```
 *    
 *    Fixed:
 *    ```
 *    const activeUrls = allUrls.filter(url => 
 *      url.status === "active" && 
 *      url.weight > 0 && 
 *      (url.clickLimit === 0 || url.clickLimit === null || url.clicks < url.clickLimit)
 *    );
 *    ```
 * 
 * 3. In getRandomWeightedUrl method, simplified the logic since we already filter URLs in getWeightedUrlDistribution:
 *    Original:
 *    ```
 *    if (selectedDistribution) {
 *      // Check if selected URL has reached its click limit
 *      if (selectedDistribution.url.clickLimit && 
 *          selectedDistribution.url.clicks >= selectedDistribution.url.clickLimit) {
 *        // Try to find another URL that hasn't reached its limit
 *        const availableUrls = activeUrls.filter(url => 
 *          !url.clickLimit || url.clicks < url.clickLimit
 *        );
 *        
 *        if (availableUrls.length) {
 *          // Pick a random URL from available ones
 *          const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * availableUrls.length);
 *          return availableUrls[randomIndex];
 *        } else {
 *          // All URLs have reached their limits, return the original selection anyway
 *          return selectedDistribution.url;
 *        }
 *      }
 *      
 *      return selectedDistribution.url;
 *    }
 *    ```
 *    
 *    Fixed:
 *    ```
 *    if (selectedDistribution) {
 *      // No need to check if the URL has reached its click limit here
 *      // because we've already filtered those out in getWeightedUrlDistribution
 *      return selectedDistribution.url;
 *    }
 *    ```
