/**
 * Traffic Generator Post-Pause Feature
 * 
 * This file implements the Traffic Generator post-pause feature, which:
 * 1. Checks campaign status after pausing
 * 2. Waits for a configurable time (default: 2 minutes)
 * 3. Checks TrafficStar spent value 
 * 4. Applies different actions based on spent value:
 *    - If < $10: Uses remaining clicks thresholds to start/pause campaigns
 *    - If â‰¥ $10: Uses budget management approach
 * 
 * See docs/traffic-generator.md for full implementation plan and details.
