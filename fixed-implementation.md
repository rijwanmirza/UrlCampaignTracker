# URL Campaign Manager - Fixed Implementation for Click Limit Handling

## Summary of Fixes

We've made the following key fixes to correctly handle URLs with unlimited clicks (clickLimit = 0):

1. Updated `getWeightedUrlDistribution` method to properly filter active URLs, including those with unlimited clicks
2. Simplified `getRandomWeightedUrl` method by removing redundant click limit checks
3. Corrected `getUrls` method to properly set the `limitReached` flag

## 1. Fixed getWeightedUrlDistribution Method

```typescript
async getWeightedUrlDistribution(campaignId: number) {
  // Get all active URLs for this campaign
  const allUrls = await this.getUrls(campaignId, true);
  
  // Filter for active URLs with weight > 0
  // A URL is considered active if:
  // 1. Its status is "active"
  // 2. Its weight is > 0
  // 3. Either it has unlimited clicks (clickLimit = 0) OR it hasn't reached its click limit
  const activeUrls = allUrls.filter(url => 
    url.status === "active" && 
    url.weight > 0 && 
    (url.clickLimit === 0 || url.clickLimit === null || url.clicks < url.clickLimit)
  );
  
  // If no active URLs, return empty result
  if (!activeUrls.length) {
    return {
      activeUrls: [],
      weightedDistribution: []
    };
  }
  
  // Rest of the method remains unchanged...
}
```

## 2. Simplified getRandomWeightedUrl Method

```typescript
async getRandomWeightedUrl(campaignId: number): Promise<UrlWithActiveStatus | null> {
  const { activeUrls, weightedDistribution } = await this.getWeightedUrlDistribution(campaignId);
  
  // If no active URLs, return null
  if (!activeUrls.length) {
    return null;
  }
  
  // If only one active URL, return it directly
  if (activeUrls.length === 1) {
    return activeUrls[0];
  }
  
  // Pick a random number in the range
  const totalRange = weightedDistribution.reduce((max, item) => 
    item.endRange > max ? item.endRange : max, 0);
  
  const randomValue = Math.floor(Math.random() * (totalRange + 1));
  
  // Find the URL that contains this random value in its range
  const selectedDistribution = weightedDistribution.find(
    item => randomValue >= item.startRange && randomValue <= item.endRange
  );
  
  if (selectedDistribution) {
    // No need to check if the URL has reached its click limit here
    // because we've already filtered those out in getWeightedUrlDistribution
    return selectedDistribution.url;
  }
  
  // Fallback to first URL if something goes wrong
  return activeUrls[0];
}
```

## 3. Corrected getUrls Method

For each occurrence of the URL click limit checking code:

```typescript
// Original implementation:
// Check if URL has reached its click limit
let limitReached = false;
if (isActive && url.clickLimit !== null && url.clickLimit > 0) {
  limitReached = url.clicks >= url.clickLimit;
}

// Fixed implementation:
// Check if URL has reached its click limit
// Note: clickLimit of 0 means unlimited clicks
let limitReached = false;
if (isActive && url.clickLimit !== null && url.clickLimit > 0 && url.clicks >= url.clickLimit) {
  limitReached = true;
}
```

## Impact of These Changes

With these fixes, URLs with clickLimit = 0 (unlimited clicks) will:
1. Never be marked as having reached their click limit
2. Always be included in the selection pool for redirection
3. Provide a proper fallback for users with valid URLs when others have reached their limits

This resolves the issue where users were incorrectly seeing "All URLs in this campaign have reached their click limits" when there were actually URLs with unlimited clicks available.
