When system will paused our camapaign after 2 minute of pausing of compaign it will check traffic star spent value for compaign and we have already traffic star spent u can fetch directly from their now after getting traffic star spent value from exist Traffic star spent section we will check what is value of traffic star spent section we will add any new thing for get spent value we will use already integrated spent section for get spent value now we will check what is compaign spent value from traffic star spent section After that here we will apply 2 condition by spent value wise for less than 10$ spent value and for more than 10$ spent value :- 

First Condition:-if we got value is less than 10$ in traffic star spent value then we will check after getting spent value in our compaign remaining click now we will check how many click is remaining in remaining click section then we will match if click is more than 15000 remaining click value then we will start traffic star campaign {Required Note: When We start compaign it will check compaign status each minute it will check status only it’s Started or not because we make compaign as  Started so if got status is started or active then nothing to do but if it paised or not running in response then we will send Start compaign request by current utc end date or 23:59 utc time same it will run continue same process for check continues status for Start when found Deactivate or paused our system will Activate /run } by run traffic star and will set end time after starting compaign current utc date or 23:59 for example today utc date is 2 may 2025 then it will set end time after start 02-05-2025 and time 23:59 and will run until remaining click limit reached to 5000 or less than 5000 after we got remaining click value of compaign is less than 5000 after starting 15000 terms then we will pause {Required Note: When We Pause compaign it will check compaign status each minute it will check status only it’s Paused or not because we make compaign as  paused so if got status is paused then nothing to do but if it Running or activated in response then we will send Paused compaign request by current utc end date or current utc time same it will run continue same process for check continues status for paused when found activated our system will paused} traffic star compaign by current utc date or current utc end time) next it will wait for to reach remaining click again by 15000 remaining click value then same process will repeat and@this condition will run until compaign spent value get more than 10$ means it will wait for 15000 click value it will start by current utc date or end time 23:59 when click value is more than 15000 or equal to 15000 and will pause if remaining click value is less than or equal to 5000  by api which I already shared u in Api docs this was FIRST CONDITON AFTER PAUSED AND LATER 2 minute action. 

But now Second condition is this We will Not Use first condition I told u After pausing Compaign of 2 minut if we got this condition @rmemeber if traffic star spent value is more than 10$ then we will not use 15000 remaining click ideology here if compaign spent value we got more than 10$ we will skip this first condition after pausing get spent value more than 10$ then we will do diff condition here we will check current compaign remaining click value then we will calculate their amount by compaign price if compaign price for 1000 click is 1$ then our remaining click is 100$ for 100000 pending click then this 100$ will be add to current traffic star spent value which we got more than 10$ for example we got more than 10$ value is 10.50$ then we will update traffic star daily budget by api to 110.50$ and will start compaign by current utc date and end time (23:59) {Required Note: When We start compaign it will check compaign status each minute it will check status only it’s Started or not because we make compaign as  Started so if got status is started or active then nothing to do but if it paised or not running in response then we will send Start compaign request by current utc end date or 23:59 utc time same it will run continue same process for check continues status for Start when found Deactivate or paused our system will Activate /run } now if we got any new url to our compaign after start traffic star spent more than 10$ condition so {we will check first traffic star spent value if its more than 10$ or less than 10$ then we will reupdate our condition which have to used } if its value is more than 10$ then we will plus their new value in traffic star daily budget by api for example we got now 1000 more required or remaining click value so we will add them after 10 minutes in exist daily budget for example in new url after plus for all existing remaining click value and starting compaign we got 1000 new more required click value then we will wait for 10 minute and will plus all new required click price to exist traffic star daily budget suppose we got 10 url and their total required click value is 5000 then we will check compaign pricing setting if its 1$ for 1000 then for 5000 more pending budget to add in 110.50+5$ then it will update all pending required click budget to exist ttrafficstar daily budget 115.50$ then same process again any new url add after this budget updation then it will wait for 10 minute and after 10 minute all pending url required click budget will plus in 115.50$ it will continue this process in loop and no duplicate budget will
Also add if any url required click budget by compaign price /1000 is added to daily budget then it will never add budget for that url {this was our second condition} 


Here is highlight for feauture which will be done after pausing compaign 
1.we will wait 2 minute ( I want option I can set minutes in place of 2 I can set any 1,2,3,4,5,,,)after paused successfully of compaign
2. We will get traffic star spent value from existing traffic star spent section .
3. Now we will check what is value of traffic star spent 
4. Now we will check value is more than 10$ or less than 10$.
     A.If Value Is Less than 10$ we will use First Condition which I told U 
     B. if value of traffic star spent got more than 10$ then we will use second condition.
     
@Now when we will Enable disable traffic generator function all process will be repeat from starting Evrything all condition will recheck
