now add 1 thing when we received more than 15000 pending required click in compaign then linked trafficstar compaign will be automatically start with end date time latest utc date and end time 23:59 note:- when it will reached to remaining 5000 click from 15000 terms it will pause compaign with pause setting as current end date time. again when 15000 or more pending click required reached same process will be run it will run until our daily spent reached to 10$ if our system detect 10$ is reched of trafficstar compaigns then this process will not repeat another condition will be applied here which will be work like this when system dtect trafficstar compaign reached 10$ or more this is 1 time process daily from utc start to utc end date this process will be applied 1 time for check 10$ spent when we will check then we will mark as we checked and update this setting for today date and will not check again 10$ spent value until utc date changed so when 10$ reached our system will pause compaign with current date and anc current utc time and will wait for 10 minutes after 10 minutes from our compaign remaianing click pricing will check and will plus to current spent amount of daily budget for example after we checked compaign spent is 10$or more than we will pick those spent value for exammple compaign spent 10.50$ now after 10 minute we will check our site compaign total pending required pricing if their is remaining pricing is 1$ then it will plus 1$ in 10.50$ like 11.50$ daily budget will be set of traffic star compaign and will start with end date of current utc date end time will be 23:59 and if we got any new url in our compaign for example after starting compaign if we got any new url entery in compaign which price we not plus in our calculation then it will continue plus for new url in traffic star daily budget for example if set 11.50$ and if any new url received in our compaign and their total price( rmember here we will plus total value after start 10$ condition)  so if url total price is 1$ we will update daily budget of trafficstar compaign to 12.50$ here is 1 more condition we have to do before add daily budget after 10$ condition if daily budget of compain is 50$ or more and we spent 40$or more it means 10$ or more amount remaining to spent in our traffic star compaign then we will not plus this new url total budget in daily budget we will wait to go 49$or until 1$ remaining in spent which budget is more than 50$ we will wait for to remain 1$ budget then we will plus all pending total url budget same this process will run until next date change of utc then same thing will be repeat from starting
