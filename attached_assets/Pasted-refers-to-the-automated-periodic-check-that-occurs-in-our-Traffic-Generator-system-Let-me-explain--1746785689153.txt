refers to the automated, periodic check that occurs in our Traffic Generator system. Let me explain exactly what happens when this process runs:

Scheduled Traffic Generator Check - What It Does
This log appears as part of our Traffic Generator scheduler, which we set up in the initializeTrafficGeneratorScheduler function in server/traffic-generator-new.ts. Here's what happens during this scheduled check:

Trigger: The system has a scheduled interval that runs every 5 minutes, set up with this code:

setInterval(() => {
  console.log('Running scheduled Traffic Generator check');
  runTrafficGeneratorForAllCampaigns();
}, 5 * 60 * 1000); // 5 minutes
Campaign Retrieval: When triggered, it fetches all campaigns with the Traffic Generator feature enabled:

const enabledCampaigns = await db.query.campaigns.findMany({
  columns: {
    id: true,
    trafficstarCampaignId: true,
  },
  where: (campaign, { eq }) => eq(campaign.trafficGeneratorEnabled, true),
});
Parallel Processing: It processes these campaigns in parallel with a controlled concurrency limit:

const CONCURRENCY_LIMIT = 2;
const chunks = [];
// Split campaigns into chunks
for (let i = 0; i < enabledCampaigns.length; i += CONCURRENCY_LIMIT) {
  chunks.push(enabledCampaigns.slice(i, i + CONCURRENCY_LIMIT));
}
// Process each chunk in parallel
for (const chunk of chunks) {
  await Promise.all(
    chunk.map(async (campaign) => {
      try {
        await processTrafficGenerator(campaign.id);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error processing campaign ${campaign.id}:`, error);
      }
    })
  );
}
Campaign State Analysis: For each campaign, it performs these key operations:

Checks the campaign's spent value by talking to the TrafficStar API
Determines if the spent value is above or below the $10 threshold
For high-spend campaigns, looks at whether it's the first time or already in high-spend state
For low-spend campaigns, potentially activates them based on remaining clicks
Checks if campaigns with low clicks need to be paused
Threshold Checks: It uses campaign-specific thresholds (as we just implemented) to determine:

If a campaign should be paused (when remaining clicks ‚â§ minimumClicksThreshold)
If a campaign should be activated (when remaining clicks ‚â• remainingClicksThreshold)
Continuous Monitoring: After initial checks, it also sets up continuous monitoring for specific campaigns:

For active campaigns: Checks every minute to ensure they stay active
For paused campaigns: Checks every minute to reactivate when remaining clicks become sufficient
For empty URL campaigns: Checks every minute to ensure they stay paused until URLs are added
The log you see, "Running scheduled Traffic Generator check", marks the beginning of this entire process, which scans all campaigns with Traffic Generator enabled and processes them according to their status, spent values, and click thresholds.

Example Scenario
In the logs, we can see that this check found campaign 995224 with a status of "paused", which is expected given its current state:

‚èπÔ∏è Campaign 995224 has 1899 remaining clicks (<= 8000) and is already paused - monitoring to ensure it stays paused
This indicates that the campaign has 1899 remaining clicks, which is below the minimum threshold of 8000, so the system is correctly keeping it paused. It also starts a minute-by-minute pause status check to ensure it stays paused until the remaining clicks exceed the threshold:

üîÑ Starting minute-by-minute PAUSE status check for campaign 995224
This is an example of how the scheduled check enforces campaign-specific threshold rules to ensure campaigns with insufficient clicks remain paused while continuously monitoring them for status changes.
